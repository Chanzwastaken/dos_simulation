# DoS Attack Simulation on a Python Flask Web Server

## Objective
This project demonstrates how a Denial of Service (DoS) attack can overwhelm a simple Python Flask web server. The attack aims to render the server unresponsive by flooding it with excessive requests. The simulation includes setting up a basic web server and executing a DoS attack against it for educational purposes.

## Contributions
- **Rendyta Moristadella** (24/550108/NPA/19965): Initial setup of the Flask web server and integration of the basic calculator functionality.
- **M. Chandra Agoeng P** (24/549761/NPA/19958): Developed the DoS attack simulation script and optimized the attack methods.
- **Nashrillah Khairu Daffa** (20/456565/PA/19752): Enhanced server performance and implemented additional security measures for testing.
- **Asyraf Nur Ardliansyah** (22/497649/PA/21439): Handled reporting for DoS attack simulation on the Python Flask web server.

## Repository Contents
- `webserver.py`: The Flask-based web server script that simulates a simple calculator.
- `importrequests2.py`: A script designed to simulate a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on the web server.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.
- **Report**: The detailed experiment report, including methodology, results, and analysis.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Flask library for the web server
- `requests` library for the DoS attack script

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install flask requests
```

## 1. Deploying the Web Server

To deploy the web server, run the following command:

```bash
python webserver.py
```

The server will be accessible on your local network at `http://0.0.0.0:5000` or via your machine's IP address.

### Web Server Features
- Simple calculator functionality (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).
- Handles basic HTTP GET and POST requests.
- Includes an intentional 0.5-second delay to simulate slower server responses.

## 2. Simulating a DoS Attack

To simulate a DoS attack on the web server, execute the following command:

```bash
python importrequests2.py
```

This script will continuously flood the server with HTTP requests, attempting to overwhelm it. The number of threads has been increased to 5000 for a more powerful attack.

### Important Notice
**This script should only be used for educational purposes in a controlled environment. Unauthorized use of this script against third-party servers is illegal and unethical.**

## Analysis and Conclusion
During our simulation, the server became unresponsive under the load generated by the DoS attack script. The terminal displayed errors such as "Max entries exceeded," confirming the success of the attack. This experiment highlights the vulnerability of poorly protected servers and emphasizes the need for stronger defense mechanisms, such as using Cloudflare or similar services to mitigate such attacks.
